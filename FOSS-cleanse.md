# Replace commonly used proprietary applications with free and open source alternatives, to free yourself from evil corporations!

## Google Drive
* I store all my files on a `FreeNAS` home server and synchronise photos and other files with other devices using `syncthing`
* You can run `syncthing` either on a virtual machine or on a jail on your server. For the jail option you can just install `syncthing` from the list of available plugins;
* Another option is to run a `Nextcloud` jail on your `FreeNAS` server. There is an android app available which allows you to link it with your mobile phone. The only downside is that it is a bit complicated to set it up over the internet, but it is still a really good option for synchronising when you are on your home network.

## Google Photos
Same as above. You can even set up `syncthing` on a Raspberry Pi if you don't want to set up a bulky pc as your home server. You can sync across multiple devices and you can even set up a special share folder with your extended family. You can keep it easy for them and connent the Pi to their TV so they can easily see the files you share.

## Microsoft Word / Excel / Powerpoint
MS Office is pretty good for productivity, however `LibreOffice` is a more than good enough alternative for home use and even pretty good for the most part for work. Honestly if you are creating simple documents, this is all you need.

## Diagrams
`draw.io` is a fantastic application for creating diagrams, which is actually much better than paid applications like Microsoft Visio, SmartDraw etc. It's a web app so it can run on pretty much anything. Just do yourself a favour and switch to it!

## Microsoft Windows
Just use Linux! I have been using `PopOS_!` for a while on my laptop after a lot of distro hoping. I recently also went Linux for my gaming PC. Honestly nowadays Linux is just much easier to use than Windows. No annoying updates and reboots all the time that break everything and that reset your privacy settings. 

## Microsoft Skype
`Jitsi` is an awesome alternative to Skype. Works great and you don't even need to create an account, you create a meeting name and share a link with other participants. Microsoft and Google have an annoying habit of terminating  

## Password management
* I have been using `Encryptr` for a while and I love it. It's decentralised which means you don't need to save any files locally. I love it for it's simplicity.
* Another option is `KeePass` which is awesome, but you have to save your password file locally.

## Social networking
Just say no to Facebook / Twitter / etc which track your everyday life and mine your private information. If you still want to keep in touch with close friends and family, `Mastodon` is an excellent alternative. There is `Tusky` which is an excellent mobile client for it.

## Instant Messagging / SMS
I use `Signal` which is nice and simple. Don't use Facebook Messenger and other things like that.

### Special mention for Linux Gaming
Gaming is a bit of a special case. 
`Steam` runs perfectly on linux and with the `Proton API` you can run most of game library on Linux nowadays. I also use `Lutris` for my `GOG` games.
