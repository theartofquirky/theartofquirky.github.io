# Replace commonly used proprietary applications with free and open source alternatives!

## Cloud storage / Google Drive
I store all my files on a `FreeNAS` home server and sync them with other devices using `syncthing`.
You can run `syncthing` either on a virtual machine or on a jail on your server.
For the jail option you can just install `syncthing` from the list of available plugins.
Another option is to run a `Nextcloud` jail on your `FreeNAS` server. There is an android mobile client as well for that, available both on `Play Store` and `F-Droid`.
I prefer to use `Nextcloud` for syncing documents to my phone over my home network that don't change very frequently, and `syncthing` for automatically syncing photos from my phone to my other devices.

## Google Photos
Same as above. You can even set up `syncthing` on a Raspberry Pi W Zero if you don't want to set up a bulky pc as your home server. 

## Microsoft Word / Excel / Powerpoint
You cannot deny MS Office is pretty good for productivity, however `LibreOffice` is very powerful, good enough for all your home needs and to be honest most of your office needs. 
If you are only creating simple docs at work then this is more than enough.

## Diagrams
`draw.io` is a fantastic application for creating diagrams, which is actually much better than paid applications like Microsoft Visio, SmartDraw etc. Just use it!

## Microsoft Windows
Just use Linux! I have been using `PopOS_!` for a while on my laptop after a lot of distro hoping.
I like `PopOS_!` because it requires minimal tweaking after installation. 
`Ubuntu`, `Manjaro` and `ElementaryOS` are also fantastic distros to consider.
I recently also went Linux for my gaming PC. 
Honestly nowadays Linux is just much easier to use than Windows. 
No annoying reboots for updates all the time that break everything and that reset your privacy settings. 

## Microsoft Skype
`Jitsi` is an awesome alternative to Skype. Works great and you don't even need to create an account, you create a meeting name and share a link with other participants.

## Password management
I use `Encryptr` for a while and I love it for its simplicity. It's decentralised which means you don't need to save any files locally.
Another good option is `KeePass`, but you have to save your password file locally.

## Social networking
If you want to keep in touch with family and close friends, I recommend `Mastodon` is an excellent alternative to Zuckbook. There is the `Tusky` mobile client which is available from `Play Store` and `F-Droid`.

## Google Mail / Email clients
`Protonmail` is pretty good but unfortunatelly they have not made their client available from `F-Droid`. For that reason I recommend using `Tutanota`.

## Instant Messagging / SMS
I use `Signal` which is nice and simple. Don't use `Facebook Messenger` / `Whatsup` and other things like that.

## Mobile app stores
`F-Droid` has a great selection of apps, check it out. For example I found `NewTube` which an excellent youtube client which allows you to subscribe to channels without logging in.

## Google Maps
Unfortunately this is an area where proprietary wins! I have not found a good alternative, especially for navigation.

## Android
`LineageOS` is excellent, however it is not as easy to install. 

### Special mention for Linux Gaming
`Steam` runs perfectly on linux and with the `Proton API` you can now run pretty much most of game library on Linux.
